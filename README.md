Hi, I’m Adam 👋  

I’m a Python developer with a strong interest in teaching game design through simple, transparent systems.  
I build games using Python and Pygame to help learners understand what’s happening *under the hood* — from game loops and input handling to rules, balance, and basic AI.

My background includes peer-led learning at Kood/Jõhvi, where collaboration, explanation, and learning-by-doing were core to the process. I enjoy breaking down complex ideas into approachable concepts, especially for beginners and younger learners.

### What I focus on
- Game design fundamentals using Python & Pygame  
- Teaching-friendly code and clear structure  
- Learning through experimentation and iteration  
- Making programming feel creative and accessible  

### Tech & tools
- Python (Pygame, scripting, simulations)
- Basic frontend (HTML/CSS)
- Go (small tools)
- Git & GitHub
- Photoshop / Illustrator (asset creation & editing)

I’m particularly interested in educational projects, mentoring, and helping new programmers build confidence through making games.
